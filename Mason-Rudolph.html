					<div class="panel-body take">
						<p>I have probably said this about all the other top QBs of the 2018 class, but Mason Rudolph is an interesting prospect. His tape leaves much to be desired, and his conference has been pointed to as a deterrent. He did have an easier career schedule than the rest of the top 6 guys, but he still had a great career TANY/A* which accounts for that. No one will call Rudolph a mobile QB, but he wasn't a statue. That combined with his size, efficiency, and steady progression is why I refer to the top of this QB class as a top 6. That was a contrarian opinion in the winter, but Rudolph has been picking up steam in recent weeks. Especially if Lamar Jackson is taken earlier than some project, I expect Rudolph to be a first rounder. Even if he is a bit of a project, there are several playoff teams with aging QBs, and I'd be surprised if he gets past all of them. He presents a nice value in both the NFL draft and rookie drafts in dynasty leagues. If you do not have (or wish to spend) a premium pick on a QB but still want a piece of this historic class, grab Rudolph as the 6th guy off the board at the position.</p>
