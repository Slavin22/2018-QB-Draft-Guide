					<div class="panel-body take">
						<p>Josh Allen is probably the most polarizing QB prospect of recent memory, and that even comes through in my personal evaluation. Efficiency-wise in college, he does not match up with most of the other top QBs. His 2016 season was okay, but his 2017 clocks in worst among any season by the top 6 QBs of this class. Since 2004, the only QB with a final season that poor to be drafted in rounds one or two is Drew Stanton. His arm strength seems to be what scouts are clinging to, but I've grown to at least like Allen as a Day 2 prospect. His combination of size and mobility is somewhat rare. The track record of first round picks with college efficiency in the range of Allen is not great, but Matt Ryan and Jay Cutler at least present themselves as role models. While I would not take him there, he has a shot to go very high in the draft, and that means something. I'm a bit higher on Allen from a fantasy perspective since he will likely get a lot of opportunity, but I'd still rather take a shot on Mason Rudolph in dynasty leagues.</p>
