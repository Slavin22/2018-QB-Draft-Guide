					<div class="panel-body take">
						<p>Baker Mayfield is an electric prospect from a statistical perspective. His college efficiency was elite overall, but his final two seasons were historic. As a senior he posted the highest TANY/A* since at least 2000, and his junior year ranks 8th. His breakout age is strong, despite missing a year due to transfer. His biggest weakness is his height, but that doesn't scare me off at all. In general, tall QBs translate better to the pros. However, QBs with great-to-elite efficiency in college have strong track records in the NFL, no matter the height. He's not as young as the other top QBs, which hurts him a bit in my evaluation of him. He still lands at #2 behind Sam Darnold in my rankings of the 2018 QB class, thanks to his elite production. For redraft however, his advanced age is a boost and his great mobility adds to that. Depending on landing spot, Mayfield or Lamar Jackson will be my top rookie QB for fantasy in 2018.</p>
